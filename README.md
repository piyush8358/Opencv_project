# #Hog
Histogram of Oriented Gradients

# Information about the project :
In this Porject i make a plot of the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature descriptor with visualization of the HOG feature vector, also i make a plot of the HOG feature vector for a given image.

# Function used in this project :
1. hog() : This function is used to compute the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature descriptor with visualization of the HOG feature vector.
2. imread() : This function is used to read an image from the specified file.
3. imshow() : This function is used to display an image in a window.
4. waitKey() : This function is used to wait for a key event infinitely or for delay milliseconds, when it is positive.
5. cvtColor() : This function is used to convert an image from one color space to another.
6. resize() : This function is used to resize an image.
7. cv2.imwrite() : This function is used to save an image to a specified file.
8. cv2.destroyAllWindows() : This function is used to destroy all of the HighGUI windows.


# Operation of the project :
1. First we import the required libraries.
2. Then we read the image using imread() function.
3. Then we convert the image into gray scale using cvtColor() function.
4. Then we resize the image using resize() function.
5. Then we compute the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature descriptor with visualization of the HOG feature vector using hog() function.
6. Then we display the image using imshow() function.
7. Then we save the image using imwrite() function.
8. Then we destroy all the windows using destroyAllWindows() function.
